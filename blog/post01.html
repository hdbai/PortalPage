						The question I chosen is What countries had access to the internet? I Google the data for this question and found that the largest amount of people using Internet comes from China. This is pretty amazing to me because China has almost the strongest Internet censorship in the world(except North Korea). people in China are not allowed to access websites like google.com or youtube.com. So, a new question arised as How could China has the largest amount of Internet users with such strong Internet censorship? The answer is that China has many websites that could be accessed by the common people. For example, with youtube.com, China has a website called youku.com. I noticed the names of two website are very similar, and indeed their functions are alike. with google.com, China has a search Engine called baidu.com. I found Baidu is the largest IT company in China, and it owns the market of search Engine in China. In general, people in China no longer need to know how to break the Internet censorship in order to get the information they want. The substitute website exists almost everywhere in China.
