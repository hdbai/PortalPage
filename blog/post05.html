					<h2>Portfolio Research Blog Post</h2>

					<p>
						<a href="https://bert.house/en/">Bert</a> is the site I think very beautiful.
						The first impression of this site is it looks very simple. It sets the background img to 100% viewpoint,
						so the very beginning part of this site is informative. When I click on its hamberg menu, the way it pops out
						is smooth, and it doesn't add too many animation to it. Most portfolio sites I viewed have too many animation in it, so it takes
						a long time to load the part I want to read. I think Bert is a good site for beginner to follow.
						<br>
						The design of Bert uses a lot of image and video. They don't have too many fancy animation in the Portfolio.
						They have a very modern design styling. They use many pure color picture as the background, and each image is in the shape
						of square with the text on the left or right. I think this style is very efficient to tell user what are we doing or showing.
						The idea of having a Hamberg menu no matter what screen size the user has makes the whole page simple.
